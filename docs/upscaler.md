# Temporal upscaling and frame generation — frame analysis and plan

## Native TAA (2026-10-01)

`upscaler=taa` / `BB_UPSCALER=taa` is a separate native-resolution temporal AA
mode on the Vulkan backend, available in the launcher and the game's menu. It uses the
existing jitter and camera/object motion vectors, reprojection, depth rejection and 3×3 neighborhood
clipping in one compute pass with two ping-pong RGBA16F histories. History stores
depth in alpha; the scene's original alpha is preserved by the HDR merge. HUD is
composed afterwards and never enters history. Output changes and AA/provider
changes reset history. TAA uses Native AA dimensions while preserving the saved
FSR preset, and does not allocate an FSR context or execute an FSR model/RCAS.
It still adds GPU work compared with disabling temporal AA; native 4K raster cost
also remains. The explicit `BB_RENDER_RES` compatibility path must be unset.

FSR Native AA is not a fast pass-through: it renders at the output resolution and
also executes the temporal reconstruction and optional sharpening. It can therefore be
slower than no AA at the same output.

`taa-shader-test` checks real SPIR-V output for accumulation, clipping, depth
disocclusion, invalid history and out-of-frame motion on Vulkan (Lavapipe works).

## Startup patch is the default again for outputs other than 1080p (2026-10-02)

The live path below made the Steam Deck and a GTX 1060 + 4-core Haswell drop to 7–8 FPS
(release 0.1 AppImage: 40–50 FPS on the Deck). With guest allocations at 1920×1080 the game's
post-processing stays at 1080p even for 720p output, guest compute passes resolve scene proxies
back to 1080p every frame (RX 7800 XT, 720p FSR 3 Performance on 4 cores: 826 vs 576
draws/frame, 185 vs 210 FPS), and on GPUs without shader stencil export every depth/stencil
copy took nine draws.

- `run.sh` again patches the game's render size for outputs other than 1080p (as in 0.1) and
  marks it with `BB_AUTO_RENDER_RES=1`, so an in-game restart recomputes it. Preset and output
  changes then need a restart (the menu offers it). `BB_LIVE_RES=1` selects the live path.
  1080p output and TAA keep the live path.
- Depth/stencil scene proxies need `VK_EXT_shader_stencil_export` again; without it these
  targets stay native (as in 0.1). `BB_SCENE_STENCIL_BITS=1` still forces the portable
  resampler for tests.

## Live resolution changes (2026-10-01)

The in-game output selector now resizes 720p/1080p/1440p/2160p host targets at a
display-pass boundary. Presets use `output / scale`, including raster sizes above
1080p (4K Quality: 2560×1440; Native AA: 3840×2160). Guest allocations stay at
1920×1080; `run.sh` no longer inserts a resolution patch for normal output choices.
The explicit `BB_RENDER_RES` compatibility override is retained.

`SceneTargets` resolves and retires old proxies before changing size. FSR resources
and history are rebuilt for the new input/output, with completion waits for both
FSR 3 and FSR 4. The 1080p path keeps HDR reconstruction before game post;
other outputs reconstruct tonemapped scene proxies at the first Scaleform pass,
then draw HUD/menu geometry into the output-size target. The display buffer is
resized too. Movie shader identification prevents a native-size fullscreen post
pass from being mistaken for UI.

Guest compute passes retain their native dispatch sizes and can resolve proxies
back to 1080p. This change does not scale every post-processing pass; performance
and intermediate detail can differ from the old startup-patched render sizes.

Verification: `out/dev/live-resolution-summary.log` switches output, preset and FSR
off/on in one PID. `BB_PRESENT_DUMP_TRIGGER` captures the completed host display
buffer (including HUD) into `BB_DUMP_DIR`. Captures confirm actual 720p/1440p/2160p
buffers. `scene-resolution-test` covers color/depth/stencil round trips through
proxies both smaller and larger than the guest allocation. `BB_PRESET_FILE` accepts
`preset [output-index [upscaler-index]]` for scripted menu-equivalent changes.

Frame analyzer: `BB_CAPTURE_TRIGGER=<file> BB_CAPTURE_DIR=<dir>`; creating the file records
the next frame (boundary: the pass writing a display buffer) — passes, targets, shaders,
sampled textures, and the first 1 KiB of bound constants for small passes and first draws.

## Bloodborne's frame (1920x1080, Hunter's Dream / Nightmare)

| Passes | What |
|---|---|
| first pass of a frame | copy of the previous UI target into the display buffer (sRGB) |
| shadow | 4096x4096 D32 depth |
| G-buffer | 6 targets 1920x1080 (RGBA8 x3, sRGB albedo, B10G11R11, RGBA16F) + D32S8 depth |
| lighting | light volumes into two B10G11R11 targets |
| scene color | RGBA16F 1920x1080, also forward/transparent draws and effects |
| volumetric fog | compute, reads linear depth (R32F 1920x1080) and composites into scene color |
| half-res effects | RGBA8 960x540 with half-res depth |
| post | combine/bloom pyramid in RGBA16F / B10G11R11 |
| tonemap | into RGBA8 1920x1080 (the UI target) |
| game AA | ping-pong RGBA8 1920x1080 after tonemap (to be skipped when upscaling) |
| UI | stencil-masked draws over the same RGBA8 target |

There is no velocity buffer, also with the camera moving: motion vectors are computed.

## Scene constants (864 bytes, bound by most passes)

Signature: `[0]=3000 (far) [1]=1/3000 [4]=1920 [5]=1080 [6]=1/1920 [7]=1/1080`.

| Floats | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 8–19 | view matrix, 3x4 rows (rotation + translation); the only block that changes with the camera |
| 36–51 | inverse projection (0.700285 = 1/1.42799, 0.39391 = 1/2.53865) |
| 52, 57, 62, 63 | projection (rows 52–67), D3D depth 0..1: x 1.42799, y 2.53865, z 1.00002 / -0.0500679 (near 0.05, far 3000) |
| 112–175 | shadow cascade matrices |
| 180–191 | inverse view (camera to world), 3x4 (176–179: 2, 8, 15, 0) |

The previous frame's matrices are not there; the port keeps them itself.

## Plan

1. Find the scene constants every frame (signature), keep the previous view/projection.
2. Camera motion vectors: compute pass from depth and current/previous matrices into an
   RG16F target; debug view to check them. Object motion later (vertex shader replay with the
   previous frame's constants through the recompiler).
3. Jitter: sub-pixel offset of clip-space positions in the scene passes (recompiler).
4. Upscaler at the scene color stage (before post and UI): FSR 3.1 first (open, native Vulkan,
   also frame generation). On the Metal backend MetalFX takes its place
   (`docs/metal/temporal_upscaling_design.md`).

## Status

- Camera motion vectors: verified by reprojecting the previous frame (`BB_DEBUG_MOTION=1`,
  toggles 1<<22 reprojected frame, 1<<23 error map): static geometry matches.
- FSR 3.1 (`BB_UPSCALER=fsr3`, FireBurn/FSR-Vulkan submodule): scene color before the
  post-processing combine (compute shader 9a9cf8a9), 1:1, RGB written back (the game keeps data
  in the alpha). Toggle 1<<24 switches it off at run time.
- Jitter: viewport offset of scene geometry (drawn with the scene depth, not full-screen
  quads), Halton(2,3) 8 phases; sign checked by sharpness (correct 255, flipped 208, off 271 —
  1:1 jitter trades high-frequency aliasing for a slightly softer image). Toggle 1<<25 off.
- Frame-to-frame difference while standing still: ~33% lower with FSR.
- Missing: motion of animated objects (characters, cloth, foliage), reactive/transparency
  masks for particles and fog, render-resolution scaling, frame generation.
